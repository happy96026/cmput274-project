Operating instructions:
Copy the bmp ship files onto both SD cards of the LCD displays.
With the Arduino connected to the computer and with the Project.cpp file and Makefile in the command prompt's current directory, upload the code to the Arduinos' IDEs using make upload. Serial monitor is not required, only used for reference.
Once the initialization is complete the Arduinos will wait to acknowledge each other. Once communication is established each player may place all five of their ships. Rotate a ships by clicking the joystick, place a ship using the pushbutton. Ships may not overlap, an error message will appear if user attempts to overlap ships. Whoever places their ships first goes on offence first.
When in offence, move the yellow cursor around the screen and fire a shot by clicking the joystick. Past shots are displayed as red (hits) or white (misses). Firing at the same location as a past shot will result in a error message on the screen. 
When in defence, watch the opponent move the cursor around both screens. However only the player in defence can see their ships on their screen.
When shots are fired the screen will display whether it was a hit or a miss with a corresponding sound effect. If a ship is entirely destroyed, the screens will tell the users which ship was destroyed. If all ships are destroyed then a winning sound effect is played and each screen will display whether the user won or lost (respectively). 

Notes: 	
- If the initialization fails, reset the Arduinos.
- If after placing the ships one moves on to offense or defense while the other is still waiting, reset the arduinos.
- When the cursor moves on the opposite screen it may move faster or slower but it will still correspond to the same square.
- There is no adjustment for the volume of the sound effects.
